# my-sinatra-project-crowdfund-app

Hello Everyone. Welcome to ComeFundUs. A crowfunding website, heavily influenced by the popular site GoFundMe. Basic functionality of this app is where you can sign up/ log in and check out other people's fundraiser and donate. Along that, you can create your own fundraiser too where other people can donate and help out in your cause.

Installation Instruction
# ##########################

First you need to download/clone this repo from github. Then in your terminal type 

```Bundle Install```

That will download and install necessary gem files for the application.
After that in the terminal type ```shotgun``` to fire up the server.

In the shotgun screen in the terminal it will give you an ip address, ending with port 9393 or some other port if that port is already occupied by another application, where you can access the site locally.

Usually http://localhost:9393 is the address you need to put in your browser.
That should bring up the site and you can sign up/Log in and donate or create a new 
Funraiser.

Thank you for checking out my app. I hope you like it.
